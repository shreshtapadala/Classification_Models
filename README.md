Classification Models : 

Classification is a process of categorizing data or objects into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes. In machine learning, classification is a type of supervised learning technique where an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset to predict the class or category of new, unseen data.

In this code, we implemented different classification models to compare the accuracy of their predictions.

Algorithms implemented : 

=> Logistic Regression

=> KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor) Algorithm

=> SVM (Support Vector Machine)

=> Naive Bayes Classification

=> Decision Tree Classification 

=> Random Forest Algorithm
